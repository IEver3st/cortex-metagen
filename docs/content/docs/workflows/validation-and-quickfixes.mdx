## Validation panel (on import)

When you open a meta file, METAGEN runs a lightweight XML validator.

- **Errors**: usually mean the XML is structurally broken (unclosed tags, mismatched brackets) and may not parse reliably.
- **Warnings**: the file might still parse, but the XML is suspicious (unescaped `&`, unquoted attribute values, duplicate attributes).

METAGEN will still attempt to parse even when warnings exist.

## Code Preview markers

The XML shown in Code Preview is validated continuously.

- Errors/warnings become Monaco markers.
- You can use the lightbulb / Code Actions for supported quick fixes.

## Supported quick fixes

Depending on what the validator detects, Monaco can offer:

- Close comment block (`-->`)
- Escape ampersand (`&` → `&amp;`)
- Quote attribute values (`attr=value` → `attr="value"`)
- Insert closing tag (`</tag>`)
- Fix mismatched closing tag
- Remove stray text line
- Remove duplicate attribute occurrence

## Limitations

This validator is intentionally simple. It focuses on common meta-file problems and editor-friendly feedback; it is not a full XML schema validator for every GTA meta variant.
