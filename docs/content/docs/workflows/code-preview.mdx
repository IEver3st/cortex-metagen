description: Live XML output, edit mode, and how raw XML edits sync back into the UI.

## Live serialization

The Code Preview panel shows the XML output for the active tab, regenerated from the current in-app state.

Updates are debounced, so rapidly moving sliders doesn’t lock up the editor.

## Edit Mode (raw XML editing)

METAGEN can switch Code Preview into **Edit Mode**:

- The editor becomes writable.
- As you type, the app re-validates the XML.
- METAGEN attempts to parse the XML and sync it back into the UI state.

### When does sync happen?

METAGEN tries to parse on every change, but it ignores parse failures while you’re typing. Once the XML is parseable, it merges the parsed result back into the vehicle list.

### Practical advice

- Use Edit Mode for small surgical changes that aren’t exposed in the UI yet.
- Prefer the UI for bulk numeric changes (sliders/inputs are safer).
- If you paste a large file, give it a moment for parsing/merging.

## Read-only mode

When Edit Mode is off, Code Preview is read-only and acts as a “source of truth” view of what will export.
