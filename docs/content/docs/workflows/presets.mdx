## What presets do

Presets are a fast way to generate sensible starter values for:

- Handling (mass, drag, power, traction, suspension, etc.)
- Vehicles (class, type, layout, audio hash)
- CarVariations (some starter color sets)

Presets do **not** automatically generate complex ModKits or VehicleLayouts data.

## Ways to create from presets

### 1) Presets button in the toolbar

- Pick a category + preset
- Name your vehicle
- Create it

### 2) New Vehicle popover (Source: Preset)

The “New Vehicle” dialog supports creating from presets too.

## Tips

- Start with a close category (e.g. “SUV”, “Offroad”, “Emergency”) and then fine-tune.
- After creating from a preset, verify:
  - `modelName` + `txdName` match your asset names
  - `handlingId` matches the Handling Name you want
  - Vehicle flags match your gameplay expectations
