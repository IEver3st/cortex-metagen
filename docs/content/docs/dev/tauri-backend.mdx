title: Tauri Backend
description: File IO commands and where the desktop/native logic lives.

## Commands

The backend provides two commands exposed to the frontend:

- `read_meta_file(path: String) -> Result<String, String>`
- `write_meta_file(path: String, content: String) -> Result<(), String>`

They are used for Open/Save.

## Plugins

The app initializes:

- Dialog plugin (open/save dialogs)
- FS plugin

## Security

The current Tauri config disables CSP (`csp: null`). If you tighten security later, validate that Monaco and any dynamic imports still work.
