## Adding a new field to an existing editor

1. Add the field to the store type (if needed).
2. Add parsing support in the XML parser.
3. Add serialization support in the XML serializer.
4. Add label/tooltip info in the dictionary.
5. Add UI control to the editor.

## Adding a new meta type

You’ll typically need:

- Type detection rule
- Parser for import
- Serializer for export
- Store shape + editor UI

## Code style

- Keep serialization deterministic (stable ordering, consistent indentation)
- Prefer safe parsing helpers (numbers/strings/attrs can vary between meta files)
- Avoid breaking existing merge behavior (case-insensitive matching is important)
