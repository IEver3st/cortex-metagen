description: Create modkit definitions with visible mods, stat mods, and slot name overrides.

## What you’re editing

The ModKits tab exports `CVehicleModelInfoVarGlobal` with `Kits` entries containing:

- `kitName`, `id`, `kitType`
- `visibleMods`
- `statMods`
- `slotNames`

## Visible Mods

Visible mods are model-based upgrades (spoilers, bumpers, etc.).

Common fields:

- Model name + shop label
- Mod type (VMT_*)
- Bone + collision bone
- Turn off bones (comma-separated list in the UI)

## Stat Mods

Stat mods describe upgrade levels for things like engine/brakes/gearbox.

METAGEN provides defaults per stat type and a shortcut to add “standard upgrades”.

## Slot name overrides

Slot names let you rename certain Los Santos Customs categories.

## Import note

ModKits are typically parsed from the same `CVehicleModelInfoVarGlobal` file as CarCols. When you open a file that includes full kit definitions, METAGEN will populate the ModKits tab.
