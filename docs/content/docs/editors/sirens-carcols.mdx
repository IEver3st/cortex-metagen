## What you’re editing

The Sirens tab edits data from `CVehicleModelInfoVarGlobal`:

- `Kits` (basic kit id + name)
- `Sirens` (siren entries and per-light data)

## Siren lights

Each siren entry can contain up to **32 lights**.

Per-light fields:

- Rotation (supports LED/rotator pattern)
- Flashness
- Delta
- Color (ARGB hex like `0xFFFF0000`)
- Scale
- Sequencer (32-bit pattern)

### Sequencer patterns

METAGEN includes a set of sequencer presets (strobe, wig-wag, etc.). These are just convenience patterns; you can still type your own.

## Light presets

The editor includes a few “starter” light presets (red/blue pair, amber strobe, etc.). Presets append lights up to the 32-light limit.

## Environmental light

Some siren entries define an environmental light color/intensity. The editor exposes both fields.
