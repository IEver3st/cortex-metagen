## What you’re editing

The Layouts tab edits data that exports as `CVehicleMetadataMgr`:

- `VehicleCoverBoundOffsetInfos`
- `FirstPersonDriveByLookAroundData`

## Cover bound offsets

Defines how far NPCs extend from the vehicle when using it as cover.

Fields:

- Name
- Extra side / forward / backward / Z offsets

## First-person look-around

Defines how the camera moves when looking around in first person while driving.

Each entry includes:

- Name
- Allow lookback
- Heading limits (X/Y)
- Left/right “side” data:
  - Offset list (offset + blend angles)
  - Extra relative pitch
  - Angle-to-blend pitch

## Export note

Layouts export merges together all cover offsets and look-around entries from every vehicle that has layouts loaded.
