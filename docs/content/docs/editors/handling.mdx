## What you’re editing

The Handling tab edits entries inside `CHandlingDataMgr/HandlingData`.

Each vehicle maps to a `handlingName` entry.

## Sections

- **Physical Attributes**: mass, drag, center of mass, inertia
- **Transmission & Engine**: power, top speed, gears, drive bias
- **Brakes & Steering**: brake force/bias, steering lock
- **Traction & Tires**: traction curves, off-road loss, low-speed loss
- **Suspension**: stiffness + damping + anti-roll + ride height
- **Damage & Misc**: collision/deformation multipliers + flags

## Performance estimates

The editor can show rough “performance estimates” to help you iterate faster.

These are not game-accurate simulations; they’re intended as directional feedback.

## Common tuning patterns

- **More grip**: raise Max/Min traction, reduce traction loss mult
- **More drift**: lower Min traction, raise low-speed traction loss, reduce drive bias front (toward RWD)
- **Less roll**: increase anti-roll + suspension force, then dial damping to avoid bouncing
