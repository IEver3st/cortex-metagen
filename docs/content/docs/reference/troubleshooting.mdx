## Import shows errors/warnings

Open triggers a validator. Common fixes:

- **Unescaped `&`**: replace with `&amp;`
- **Mismatched tags**: check closing tags and nesting
- **Duplicate attributes**: remove the extra attribute

If the file still imports despite warnings, verify output in Code Preview and re-export.

## “No data loaded for this tab”

This means the active vehicle does not have that meta type marked as loaded.

Fix options:

- Import the corresponding `.meta` file
- Create a new vehicle from **Blank** (includes several types by default)
- Switch to a tab that is loaded

## Save exports an empty file

Exports filter by “loaded meta”. If nothing is loaded for that type, you’ll export only the header/root with no items.

## Edit Mode changes don’t stick

Edit Mode sync relies on the parser being able to parse the current XML.

- If you’re mid-edit and XML is invalid, sync is skipped.
- Fix validation errors and wait a moment; the UI should update once parse succeeds.

## Layouts/ModKits seem to apply to the “wrong vehicle”

Layouts and ModKits are treated more like shared datasets. Import assigns them to the first suitable vehicle entry.

If you prefer, keep a dedicated vehicle named something like `GLOBAL_LAYOUTS` / `GLOBAL_MODKITS` and store these there.
