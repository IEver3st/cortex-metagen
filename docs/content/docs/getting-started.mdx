## Install & run

METAGEN is a Tauri desktop app.

### Prerequisites (development)

- **Bun** (used by the Tauri config as the dev/build runner)
- **Rust toolchain** (for Tauri)
- **Node.js** (for the frontend toolchain; Bun can cover most tasks, but Node is still commonly required by some tooling)

### Dev

From the project root:

- Frontend only: `bun run dev`
- Full desktop app: `bun run tauri:dev`

### Build

- Frontend bundle: `bun run build`
- Desktop bundle: `bun run tauri:build`

## First edit (5 minutes)

1. Click the **+** next to the vehicle dropdown.
2. Create a vehicle using **Blank**, **Preset**, or **Copy**.
3. Use the tabs to edit:
   - Handling → driving feel
   - Vehicles → model links / class / flags
4. Toggle the **code** icon to show the XML preview.
5. Click **Save** (or press **Ctrl+S**) to export the active tab.

## Importing existing meta files

Use **Open** (or press **Ctrl+O**) and select a `.meta` or `.xml` file.

On import METAGEN will:

1. Run XML validation (errors/warnings appear in the Validation Panel)
2. Detect the meta type based on the XML content (with a filename fallback)
3. Parse it and merge it into the current vehicle list
4. Switch you to the detected tab when possible

## Saving/exporting

Save always exports **the active tab** to a `.meta` (or `.xml`) file.

Important details:

- Export is *type-specific* (Saving in Handling exports handling XML, etc.)
- Only vehicles with that meta type “loaded” are included
- Layouts export merges data across all vehicles with layouts loaded
