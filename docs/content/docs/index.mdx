## What is METAGEN?

Cortex METAGEN is a desktop app (Tauri + React) that helps you create and edit common GTA V vehicle configuration “meta” files with a structured UI and a live XML preview.

It’s designed for modders who want:

- A form-based editor for the most-used meta fields
- A live XML view that stays in sync with the UI
- Basic XML validation and Monaco quick-fixes for common errors
- Presets to bootstrap believable handling + vehicles setups quickly

## Supported meta types

METAGEN organizes work into tabs. Each tab corresponds to one meta “type”:

- **Handling** → `handling.meta`
- **Vehicles** → `vehicles.meta`
- **Sirens** → `carcols.meta` (Sirens + Kits)
- **ModKits** → `modkits.meta` (Kits with visible/stat mods + slot names)
- **CarVariations** → `carvariations.meta`
- **Layouts** → `vehiclelayouts.meta`

> Note: `carcols.meta` can contain both **Sirens** and **Kits**. METAGEN will read modkit information from the same file when present.

## UI tour (high level)

- **Top bar**: vehicle selector, “new vehicle”, presets, tabs, open/save, edit mode toggle, code preview toggle.
- **Left panel**: the active editor tab.
- **Right panel**: **Code Preview** (Monaco). Shows the XML output for the active tab.
- **Validation panel** (appears after opening a file): shows XML warnings/errors detected on import.
- **Status bar**: vehicle count, current tab, which meta types are loaded for the active vehicle, dirty/unsaved indicator, file breadcrumb.

## Key concepts

### Vehicles are “containers”

Internally, METAGEN keeps a list of vehicles. Each vehicle stores the data for the different meta types (handling, vehicles, etc.).

### “Loaded meta” controls what exports

Each vehicle tracks which meta types are actually loaded/available for it. When you export, METAGEN only serializes vehicles that have that meta type marked as loaded.

This prevents exporting empty/stub entries if you only imported one file type.

### Layouts and ModKits behave more “global”

- **Layouts** export merges together all cover offsets + look-around entries from all vehicles that have layouts loaded.
- **ModKits** are typically a shared list; import assigns parsed modkits to the first suitable vehicle entry.

If you want a single “global” ModKits/Layouts vehicle, it’s normal to keep it that way.

## Recommended workflow

1. Create or select a vehicle.
2. Use **Presets** (optional) to bootstrap handling/vehicles.
3. Import any existing `.meta` files you already have.
4. Use the editor tabs for structured changes.
5. Use **Code Preview** for sanity checks (and optionally edit raw XML in Edit Mode).
6. Save/export the active tab to a new `.meta` file.
