# How To Suggest Features

We welcome community feedback and ideas! The best way to suggest a new feature or improvement is by opening an issue on GitHub. This allows us to track requests, discuss implementation details, and keep everything organized.

### Steps to Submit a Feature Request:

1. **Navigate to the Issues Tab:**
Go to the main page of the repository and click on the **Issues** tab near the top.
2. **Start a New Issue:**
Click the green **New Issue** button on the right side.
3. **Choose the Right Type:**
If you see issue templates, select **Feature Request** (or similar). If not, simply open a blank issue.
4. **Describe Your Idea:**
* **Title:** Give it a clear, concise title (e.g., "Add Dark Mode Support").
* **Description:** Explain what you want to achieve.
* *What is the problem you are trying to solve?*
* *How do you envision the solution working?*
* *Screenshots or mockups are highly encouraged if applicable.*


5. **Submit:**
Click **Submit new issue** to post your suggestion.
